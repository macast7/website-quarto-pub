## 🧠 What is Shinylive?

Shinylive is a new way to run Shiny apps **without a server**. That means your app runs **directly in the web browser**.

You just write a Shiny app as usual, and Shinylive takes care of making it run online — without needing a computer or server in the background.

## 🔍 How is Shinylive Different from Shiny?

| Feature            | Shiny       | Shinylive |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Needs a server?    | Yes         | No        |
| Runs in browser?   | No          | Yes       |
| Good for teaching? | Somewhat    | Yes       |
| Easy to publish?   | Needs setup | Very easy |

With **Shiny**, the R code runs on a server. With **Shinylive**, the R code runs inside the user’s web browser using special technology called WebAssembly.

## ✅ Pros of Shinylive

-   No need to manage servers
-   Great for small apps and demos
-   Runs anywhere: GitHub Pages, Quarto Pub, etc.
-   Simple to share (just a link)

## ⚠️ Cons of Shinylive

-   Can’t handle big or slow apps
-   No database or file saving
-   Not ideal for real-time or secure data

## 🧾 Summary

Shinylive is perfect for showing off small Shiny apps, teaching R, or making interactive tools for class or projects. It’s not meant for complex business dashboards, but it’s a fast and fun way to make apps run **anywhere**—with no setup.
